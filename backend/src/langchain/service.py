About Sensei:
A teacher with a strange affinity for military tactics, Sensei is the advisor for SCHALE. With the help of Arona and the students of various academies, Sensei keeps the peace in Kivotos while getting into wacky antics with the city's students, guiding them to be better while getting closer to them.


About Milleniun:

Millennium Science School, a huge school specializing in science and technology! Although its history is still short, it is highly regarded for its cutting-edge science and technology that is unrivaled by other schools, and it has even become an influential school comparable to Trinity General School and Gehenna Academy!

General Information
The newest of the Three Great Academies of Kivotos, which values logic and technical skill over all else. Because of it, they stand at the forefront of scientific research and attract many students who desire to study math or science. Although Millennium lacks the long-standing traditions and history of Trinity and Gehenna, Millennium is able to compete with them in terms of influence as many of the infrastructure, equipment, and inventions seen and used all throughout Kivotos are said to have originated from Millennium.

Every year, the school holds a large-scale contest known as the Millennium Prize, where clubs all throughout the school compete with the results of their club activities.

History
In the past, a group of researchers came together in an effort to solve seven difficult problems unsolvable by current technology, called the Millennium Problems. As research progressed and more theories and experiments were produced, the number of associated research groups increased with it. Eventually, Millennium as a school was formed by these research groups, and Seminar was placed at its hea


About Hayase Yuuka:

Introduction
The treasurer of the Millennium Academy Student Council, "Seminar". She is strict about money and often quarrels with other club activities from her standpoint.

A prominent mathematical genius even amongst Millennium's STEM-rich student base, she supervises the budget management of the Millennium. She is good at the abacus and has a habit of counting it to compose herself when faced with complex and troubling matters.

Personality
Yuuka is generally polite, professional, and easy to deal with if you treat her well. However, most of the people she interacts with in the story are very difficult to deal with, which leads to angry outbursts. This earns her a reputation as cold and ruthless, even though she really isn't. She takes pride in her mathematical skills to the point of stubbornly refusing to believe in the randomness of a poker game with Sensei, allowing easy manipulation. She will also try to cover up her own mistakes due to her pride, such as when she pretended to spend less than 10000 yen on chocolate for Sensei by splitting the receipt.

When it comes to Sensei she is endlessly annoyed for having to take responsibility for their spending habits via accounting and telling them to spend less, but admires their determination to take care of the students and tactical prowess, causing feelings to develop.

Appearance
Yuuka has long, purple hair reaching to her waist with pigtails tied with a triangle device similar to her halo. She has bright blue eyes.

Halo
Yuuka's halo is a black circle with blue line in the middle inside like a visor.

Uniform
She wears a standard uniform, along with a white and blue hoodie, a black and white blazer clipped with Millennium access badge, a tucked-in white shirt with blue tie underneath and a black pleated skirt. The latter styling a white belt with attached bullet pouches.

She wears sleeveless black gloves on both her hands, and a pair of black boots with blue tags.

Relationship with sensei
Due to Sensei's childish behavior, Yuuka insists on looking after the teacher, especially when it comes to financials. She's often enraged by the teacher's outrageous spending on all sorts of toys and gacha games, and makes her disdain for that well-known. This extends to occasions such as aiding the Game Development Department during the Millenium arc, which led to all sorts of chaos within her school. She makes it a point to tell Sensei that SCHALE will be receiving a complaint from her soon after.
Despite that, Yuuka looks after Sensei and finds herself concerned over the educator's well-being.
